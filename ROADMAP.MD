# Roadmap

The goal is for Sant√© to be a lightweight Java-based desktop application that pings scheduled health reminders. To build it to that point, we need to look ahead.

## Java Project

### Milestone: Basic Console Version (In Progress)

Our application lets the user schedule custom reminders on independent threads, cancel those reminders, or delete them. [See progress here.](https://github.com/CPP-SEA/sante/projects/1)

### Milestone: Basic GUI Version
At this stage, the user will see a simple GUI with the list of reminders and the option to enable/disable each one. No menus and no sounds. Prototype desktop notifications in the form of a small rectangle on the bottom right of the screen popping up.

### Milestone: Advanced GUI Version
Refine the interface, add menus, preferences and sounds. At this stage, we should have reminders being saved and loaded.

## Web Project

### Milestone: Basic Website (Not Started)

Use HTML and CSS to share basic information about the project, how to download it, and where to contribute to it.

### Milestone: Web Application

VueJS (?) application that pings reminders from the browser.
